# tracker_trigger
lua script for OBS

check a file for pattern match

if there is a match, enable source(s) visibility

so, what does this do? not much at the moment

what is the goal? play a sound if a pattern does NOT match.

also, there should be a temp file be created for the duration of which the overlay is active?
