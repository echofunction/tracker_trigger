# tracker_trigger
lua script for OBS

check a file for pattern match

if there is a match, enable source(s) visibility

so, what does this do? not much at the moment

what is the goal? play a sound if a pattern does NOT match.

also, a temp file should be created when a decktracker (+ overlay) becomes active
& automatically deleted when a tracker (+ overlay) is closed
